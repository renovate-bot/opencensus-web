## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

**GA**: Libraries defined at a GA quality level are stable, and will not introduce
backwards-incompatible changes in any minor or patch releases. We will address issues and requests
with the highest priority. If we were to make a backwards-incompatible changes on an API, we will
first mark the existing API as deprecated and keep it for 18 months before removing it.

**Beta**: Libraries defined at a Beta quality level are expected to be mostly stable and we're
working towards their release candidate. We will address issues and requests with a higher priority.
There may be backwards incompatible changes in a minor version release, though not in a patch
release. If an element is part of an API that is only meant to be used by exporters or other
opencensus libraries, then there is no deprecation period. Otherwise, we will deprecate it for 18
months before removing it, if possible.

**Alpha**: Libraries defined at a Alpha quality level can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss. Alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version. The API is subject to change.
